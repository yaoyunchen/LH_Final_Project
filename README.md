# Glimpse
Glimpse is a global exploration and social discovery app that aims to provide a tranquil but visually-stimulating experience.

This project was created with the intention of providing a view into different cultures through the lens of other social explorers.

Users choose where they would like to 'visit' on an interactive map, and can toggle between Video and Audio modes to attain both a visual and auditory "glimpse" of the countries across the globe.

The project was created using React.js, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3, in combination with the Sinatra framework. The project integrated data from Flickr API as well as the SoundCloud API.
